# Arduino_EV_Shield_simple_drive
Simple code for EVShield to run and drive around. Had to delete old repository with commits, because commits included personal information.

This is simple code using some trigonometry to drive a EVShield around

Depends on the [EVShield](https://github.com/mindsensors/EVShield) library
